# A Thesis Template in Word

This is a template that uses Word styles to create a nice looking and easy to use document for your thesis. You should check your deparment's regulations on thesis formatting and tweak the styles accordingly before you submit. 

All the documents were made using Microsoft Word for Microsoft 365 MSO (Version 2008, Build 13127.21064, 64-bit). The documents are:
* __Thesis_and_Cover_Template.docx__ - An example DOCX document formatted with styles and ready to use.
* __Thesis_and_Cover_Template.pdf__ - A PDF version of the document to browse an example of the end result.
* __Thesis_and_Cover_Template.dotx__ - A DOTX template document (opening it will create a new DOCX document based on the styles of the template).
* __Thesis_Style.dotx__ - The style of the template.
* __Thesis_Theme.thmx__ - The theme of the template.

__Sections included in the template:__ Cover, Preface, Acknowledgements, Dedication, Quote, Abstract, Impact Statement, Statement of Contributions, Contents, List of Figures, List of Tables, Abbreviations, Introduction, Methods, Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Chapter 4, Discussion, References, Appendix.

Word is not famous for handling really large files, so it is a good idea to learn how to create and use a master document with sub-documents for each chapter. For this and other tips on using this template, check out the accompanying [blog post](https://oriolpavon.com/2021/02/08/thesis-template-in-word/).
